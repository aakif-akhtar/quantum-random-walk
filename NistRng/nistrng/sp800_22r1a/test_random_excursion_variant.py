class RandomExcursionVariantTest(Test):
    """
    Random excursion variant test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of this test is the total number of times that a particular state is visited (i.e., occurs) in a cumulative sum random walk.
    The purpose of this test is to detect deviations from the expected number of visits to various states in the random walk.
    This test is actually a series of eighteen tests (and conclusions), one test and conclusion for each of the
    states: -9, -8, ..., -1 and +1, +2, ..., +9.

    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
