    Monobit test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test is to determine
    whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would be expected for a truly random sequence.
    The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1/2, that is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence
    should be about the same.

    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
