class FrequencyWithinBlockTest(Test):
    """
    Frequency within block test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of the test is the proportion of ones within M-bit blocks. The purpose of this test is to determine whether the frequency of
    ones in an M-bit block is approximately M/2, as would be expected under an assumption of randomness.
    For block size M=1, this test degenerates to the Frequency (Monobit) test.

    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
