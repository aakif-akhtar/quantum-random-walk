class RandomExcursionTest(Test):
    """
    Random excursion test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of this test is the number of cycles having exactly K visits in a cumulative sum random walk.
    The cumulative sum random walk is derived from partial sums after the (0,1) sequence is transferred to the appropriate (-1, +1) sequence.
    A cycle of a random walk consists of a sequence of steps of unit length taken at random that begin at and return to the origin.
    The purpose of this test is to determine if the number of visits to a particular state within a cycle deviates from what one would expect
    for a random sequence. This test is actually a series of eight tests (and conclusions), one test and conclusion for each of the
    states: -4, -3, -2, -1 and +1, +2, +3, +4.

    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
